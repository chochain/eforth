cr .( example 7.  money exchange )

( the first example we will use to demonstrate how numbers are
used in forth is a money exchange program, which converts money
represented in different currencies.  let's start with the
following currency exchange table:

        33.55 nt        1 dollar
        7.73 hk         1 dollar
        9.47 rmb        1 dollar
        1 ounce gold    285 dollars
        1 ounce silver  4.95 dollars )

decimal

: nt    ( nnt -- $ )    100 3355 */  ;
: $nt   ( $ -- nnt )    3355 100 */  ;
: rmb   ( nrmb -- $ )   100 947 */  ;
: $rmb  ( $ -- njmp )   947 100 */  ;
: hk    ( nhk -- $ )    100 773 */  ;

: gold  ( nounce -- $ ) 285 *  ;
: $gold ( $ -- nounce ) 285 /  ;
: silver ( nounce -- $ ) 495 100 */  ;
: $silver ( $ -- nounce ) 100 495 */  ;
: ounce ( n -- n, a word to improve syntax )  ;
: dollars ( n -- )      . ;

( with this set of money exchange words, we can do some tests:

        5 ounce gold .
        10 ounce silver .
        100 $nt .
        20 $rmb .

if you have many different currency bills in your wallet, you
can add then all up in dollars:

cr .( example 8. temperature conversion )

( converting temperature readings between celcius and farenheit
is also an interesting problem.  the difference between temperature
conversion and money exchange is that the two temperature scales
have an offset besides the scaling factor. )

        ;

: c>f ( ncelcius -- nfarenheit )

        32 +
        ;

( try these commands

90 f>c .        shows the temperature in a hot summer day and
0 c>f .         shows the temperature in a cold winter night. 

in the above examples, we use the following forth arithmatic
operators:

+       [ n1 n2 -- n1+n2 ]      add n1 and n2 and leave sum on stack.
-       [ n1 n2 -- n1-n2 ]      subtract n2 from n1 and leave differrence
                                on stack.
*       [ n1 n2 -- n1*n2 ]      multiply n1 and n2 and leave product
                                on stack.
/       [ n1 n2 -- n1/n2 ]      divide n1 by n2 and leave quotient on
                                stack.
*/      [ n1 n2 n3 -- n1*n2/n3] multiply n1 and n2, divide the product
                                by n3 and leave quotient on the stack.
.s      [ ... -- ... ]          show the topmost 4 numbers on stack.

cr .( example 12.      sines and cosines )

( sines and cosines of angles are among the most often encountered
transdential functions, useful in drawing circles and many other
different applications.  they are usually computed using floating
numbers for accuracy and dynamic range.  however, for graphics
applications in digital systems, single integers in the range from
-32768 to 32767 are sufficient for most purposes.  we shall
study the computation of sines and cosines using the single
integers.

the value of sine or cosine of an angle lies between -1.0 and +1.0.
we choose to use the integer 10000 in decimal to represent 1.0
in the computation so that the sines and cosines can be represented
with enough precision for most applications.  pi is therefore
31416, and 90 degree angle is represented by 15708.  angles
are first reduced in to the range from -90 to +90 degrees,
and then converted to radians in the ranges from -15708 to
+15708.  from the radians we compute the values of sine and
cosine.

the sines and cosines thus computed are accurate to 1 part in
10000.  this algorithm was first published by john bumgarner
in forth dimensions, volume iv, no. 1, p. 7. )

cr .( example 13.      square root )

( there are many ways to take the square root of an integer.  the
special routine here was first discovered by wil baden.  wil
used this routine as a programming challenge while attending
a forml conference in taiwan, 1984.

this algorithm is based on the fact that the square of n+1 is equal
to the sum of the square of n plus 2n+1.  you start with an 0 on
the stack and add to it 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., until the sum is greater
than the integer you wished to take the root.  that number when
you stopped is the square root.
)

: sqrt ( n -- root )
        1600000000 over <               ( largest square it can handle)
        if drop 40000 exit then         ( safety exit )
        >r                              ( save sqaure )
        1 1                             ( initial square and root )
        begin                           ( set n1 as the limit )
                over r@ <              ( next square )
        while
                dup 2 * 1 +              ( n*n+2n+1 )
                rot + swap
                1 +                     ( n+1 )

cr .( example 14.      radix for number conversions )

decimal

( : decimal       10 base! ; )
( : hex           16 base! ; )
: octal         8 base!  ;
: binary        2 base!  ;

( try converting numbers among different radices:

        decimal 12345 hex  .

        decimal 100 binary  .
        binary 101010101010 decimal  .

real programmers impress on novices by carrying a hp calculator
which can convert numbers between decimal and hexadecimal.  a
forth computer has this calculator built in, besides other functions.
